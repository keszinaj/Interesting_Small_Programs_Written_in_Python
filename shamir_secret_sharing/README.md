How does it even work?
Idea is pretty easy. 
If we have n points(x_1,x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5, ..., x_n) and coresponding values(y_1, y_2, y_3, y_4, y_5, ..., y_n) we can cleary define one polynomial.
To calculate that we can use Lagrange interpolation.
Lagrange interpolation has always only one clear sollution. 



How the key will look like
n|common|secret
n - degree of polynomial






Problems not solved: 
Key distribution showing every key is not good. Maybe we will show it one by one, yes, one by one would be good option
